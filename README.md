# Math Programming
A recreation of my old math projects on Scratch, along with other math-themed projects.
To use the Python them without GUIs, set every "return" to "print" and uncomment the bottom lines.
Use IDLE for Python, Code::Blocks for the Fortran, D, C, and C++ (with MinGW on Windows), Visual Studio for Visual Basic, and the JRE with the batch file provided for the Java.
If using Visual Studio, convert all stdio to stdafx headers for C++. Also, ensure that C++11 or higher is selected.
Use CLISP with the LispIDE for the Lisp files and Strawberry Perl for the Perl files.
