# Math Programming

## Introduction

### What is this?

This respository began as a recreation of my old math projects on Scratch, along with other math-themed projects.
Now, it has grown into an amalgamation of small projects that wouldn't quite fit anywhere else, or which don't deserve their own repository. Descriptions of these various projects are below, organized by programming language.
This repository also documents my growth as a programmer as I learn new languages and techniques, and put them to use for the first time.

### How do I use this?

The different languages require different setups, naturally.
The Python files are all designed to work with any installation of Python 3.5 or later.
The Code::Blocks IDE was used for the Fortran, D, C, and C++ files (with MinGW on Windows), so this should be a guaranteed working solution if everything else fails.
Use Visual Studio for Visual Basic and C#, the most recent version of the JDK/JRE for the Java files, CLISP with the LispIDE for the Lisp files, SWI-Prolog for the Prolog files, and Strawberry Perl for the Perl files.
This should all work fairly well without any difficulties. The languages not mentioned should not need any special setup procedures.
